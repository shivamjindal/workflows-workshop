Add a Chatbot UI element here and have it reference a `\\@{conversation}` state element\n2. Create a new workflow called `chat-with-kg`\n3. You'll need three blocks for the chatbot below to work: Initialize chat, Add to Chat, and Complete Chat. \n   a. **Initialize chat**: This will only really be executed once. But it'll actually initialize the conversation state element\n   b. **Add chat message**: This adds a user's sent message directly into the conversation state element\n   c. **Chat Completion**: This actually has the LLM respond to the user's message. It also has tool calling abilities (other paths in the workflow, or a Knowledge Graph)\n\n4. Connect the 3 blocks mentioned above together in order, use the `conversation` state element in each block to reference the same conversation. \n5. Now connect the chatbot UI element with the workflow you just created by editing the `wf-chatbot-message` handler. \n6. Try sending a message. It was probably a bit wonky. There's one more step.
